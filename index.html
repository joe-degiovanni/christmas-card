    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Alice</h2>

    <p>
        Alice turned 6 in November and is in her first year (Kindergarten) in St. Joseph. Alice will scream for joy at
        many things, such as receiving a piece of gum. She is making friends fast in class apparently, and appears to
        spread laughter amongst friends. Kristina can't keep up with her birthday party invites. Her hobbies include
        gymnastics and living on the edge of what is safe and what is dangerous. She wants and feels entitled to
        anything that Ada has or gets to do. When Mom and Dad tell her anything, her response is "yeh, I know." She is
        Zygi's biggest fan and loves on him hard, until she is upset at him for chewing a toy and tells us we never
        should have got a dog. Alice drives their little pink Jeep around the farm like she is a boss. Everything is
        more fun with Alice, come and see for yourself! $50 I'll bet that when you start exchanging knock knock jokes
        she will make you laugh.

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Ada</h2>

    <p>
        Ada is 7 years old and a second grader in St. Joseph. She taught her little sister how to ride the bus and the
        ins and outs of school. Her, Alice and Everett (cousin neighbor) still manage to fit all three of them in a bus
        seat together :) On the bus they enjoy eating tictacs, looking at small toys they hide in their backpacks, and
        not talking to each other (tired from getting up at 6:20am). Ada's hobbies include hip-hop dance class and
        Gymnastics. She doesn't believe any food is desert unless it is chocolate. When you look at Ada, you can tell a
        lot is going on in her mind, but you can rarely tell how she is feeling- very unlike her sister. She feels
        deeply, and says caring is her super power but also reserves any token of affection for friends and family whom
        she has known pretty much for life. We love her fiercely and can't wait till she marries Alice and builds a
        house behind ours because she loves us all so much.

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Kristina</h2>

    <p>
        Kristina loves to continue to stay involved with as many friends as possible, planning get togethers or inviting
        people to days at the farm whenever possible. Joe may think she has no hobbies, however she fires back that
        following music, artists, and going to concerts is as good of a hobby as any. This year was just like any other
        as she attended 8 concerts of the Milk and Honey patio sessions, The Head and the Heart/ Revivalists and Lindsey
        Stirling at the Ledge Amphitheater, Cirque De Solie, Into the Woods at the Guthrie, P!nk/Brandi in Fargo, Brandi
        and Wynonna Judd at the State Fair, and Beauty and the Beast at the Paramount. Kristina's job has been mediocre
        with some ups and down in the past year, although she really loves getting to review nursing home patients'
        medications with abnormal levels of excitement. In 2024 she hopes to go on more date nights with her husband to
        sushi restaurants.

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Joe</h2>

    <p>
        I am doing my best to learn how to take care of things on the farm; I'm a slow learner. I had a great time
        with SJU friends on a September canoe trip to the BWCA.

    <h2>✈️ We traveled!</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>In 2024 we tried our first cruise (and family Disney experience) over spring break on the Disney Wish ship.
            It was a great fit for our family and no one managed to get sea sick! We also took a week in the summer to
            visit Okoboji with long-time friends and packed 3 families in one house over Ada’s birthday. Joe and I were
            able to travel to a music festival in Montana with friends- an unforgettably good time that included hiking
            in Glacier National Park. Before summer ended Joe and I gambled on taking our first family road trip to the
            Badlands and Black Hills in SD. Wonderful memories were made outside of the really unpleasant long drive
            home. Joe had a successful fall BWCA trip and trip to Dallas, TX to catch a surprise birthday concert of his
            favorite artists (Sierra Farrel and Nick Shoulders) with some best friends.
        </li>
        <li>We also were lucky to have a beautiful staycation with Kristina’s family who were in MN to celebrate her
            cousin Shannon’s wedding. Starting in Stillwater, stopping in St. Joseph and ending at Grandview Lodge in
            Nisswa, it felt so wonderful to spend relaxed quality time together.

    <h2>🔦 Spotlight on Alice</h2>

    <p>
        Alice is in 1st grade this year but is hanging onto the coattails of her sister's level of reading. In class she
        is loved for being a great role model, yet also a class goofball. Alice has also been participating in hip hop,
        swimming and gymnastics and wants to take piano lessons next year. She still doesn’t need as much sleep as the
        rest of the family, and has been the most attentive for bedtime reading- always wanting 1 more page. We now have
        read the Hobbit, all the Lord of the Rings, and just started book 6 of Harry Potter.
    </p>
    </p>
    <b>Alice’s self summary:</b> I like jumping on the trampoline, drawing, and presents. Also I am the smallest
    person in our family.

    <h2>🔦 Spotlight on Ada</h2>

    <p>
        Ada is in 3rd grade this year. She has been involved in hip hop dance class (5th year in dance), dabbled in
        gymnastics and swimming, and is hoping to start piano lessons and beginners basketball in the new year. She
        takes the responsibility of being the eldest sister and cousin on the compound very seriously. Ada would prefer
        to craft and draw above all other things. Highlights of things she has made include a giant (26 8x11 pages)
        paper origami frog, pop out cards, paper purses and a 3D paper santa’s workshop. She loves going out for
        cheeseburgers, and just getting out of the house in general.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Ada's self summary:</b> I am really good at dance. I like art and crafts. And I like to spend time with my
        cousins.

    <h2>🔦 Spotlight on Kristina</h2>

    <p>
        Merry Christmas to you all! I still love music. I’m also on my 8th year with Guardian Pharmacy based out of Sauk
        Rapids, working from home and in skilled nursing homes in the area. It’s a very cool job, made less cool by
        financial, business, and staff problems. Fortunately, I did have an opportunity to attend the annual consultant
        pharmacist meeting with peers in Denver, CO in November and was reminded of what greater purpose I serve in
        healthcare. I have also been appreciating the growing friendships I have been working on since moving to
        Sartell/St. Joseph. I can’t tell you how powerful these women are who help me celebrate International Women’s
        Day every year.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Christmas, I am asking everyone to lock and secure all firearms in the house. I have enjoyed participating
        in the local Mom’s Demand Action group in St. Cloud, and the annual Wear Orange event that St. Joseph puts on
        every June to raise awareness of gun violence. And though all my efforts with this seem rewarding, it was still
        completely terrifying to receive notice from my children’s school that a firearm had been found in a locker
        during class in November. 100% preventable. Lock up your guns.

    <h2>🔦Joe and Zygi</h2>

    <p>
        Last and arguably least, Joe and Zygi are settling into their roles as permanent fixtures on the farm. Zygi is
        there by Joe's feet while he works from home. Zygi is there when Joe is working on his timberframe projects.
        Zygi is there when Joe... you get the idea.
    </p>

    <p>
        You might have noticed something different about Joe this year, 2024 was Joe's Year of the Mustache. Joe decided
        to see what the terminal mustache length he could achieve. Kristina was hopeful that "terminal" in this context
        meant death, but Joe meant it in the sense of how long would it grow if he just never trimmed it.

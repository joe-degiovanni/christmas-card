    <h2>‚úàÔ∏è We traveled!</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Ireland ‚òòÔ∏è - Joe travelled to visit his favorite coworkers in Dublin, and Kristina came along to keep Joe
            out of trouble. We really enjoyed the hospitality and conversations. Also, Joe's aunt and uncle, Cheri and
            Kevin, coincidentally were traveling in Ireland at the same time, so we got to meet up with them for an 
            evening in Dublin!
        </li>
        <li>Charleston - Kristina's dad, Joel, had a milestone birthday and his daughters offered plane tickets anywhere
            in the country, provided they got to come with :-) Vicki, Wes, and Joe were lucky enough to be invited too.
            We had a great time touring historic Charleston, eating great food, drinking great drinks, and we met a very
            well-endowed horse named Teddy!
        </li>
        <li>Ely - While school was out for MEA weekend, we took advantage of the long weekend to take the family up to
            the always fun Ely, MN
        </li>
        <li>Fargo - Kristina took Ada and Alice to the P!nk Concert (with opener Brandi Carlisle) ü§ò</li>
        <li>Brainerd - We brought the kids to an indoor waterpark in Brainerd for an easy winter get-away</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üêï Meet Our New Golden Retriever Puppy -- Zygi</h2>

    <p>
        Kristina has been wanting a dog for a long time, and Joe has been resisting. In honor of the Vikings, we named
        him Zygi "Wolf" after Vikings' owner Zygi Wilf. He enjoys shoes, chewing on things, chasing chickens, barking
        at sheep, and carrying firewood all over the property.
    </p>

    <p>
        He gave us a bit of a scare as a puppy as he had a battle with parvovirus, which it turns out can be fatal.
        He was in and out the vet for about a week being hooked up to an IV since he wouldn't eat or drink. He pulled
        through though, and he's been a healthy and happy puppy ever since.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jim and Kristina brought him to obedience training this summer. Let's say he's a work in progress. In addition
        to basic obedience, he's learning to catch a frisbee. Also, He went on his first pheasant hunt this fall, and he
        did surprisingly well for not having any bird dog training.
    </p>

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Alice</h2>

    <p>
        Alice turned 6 in November and is in her first year (Kindergarten) in St. Joseph. Alice will scream for joy at
        many things, such as receiving a piece of gum. She is making friends fast in class apparently, and appears to
        spread laughter amongst friends. Kristina can't keep up with her birthday party invites. Her hobbies include
        gymnastics and living on the edge of what is safe and what is dangerous. She wants and feels entitled to
        anything that Ada has or gets to do. When Mom and Dad tell her anything, her response is "yeh, I know." She is
        Zygi's biggest fan and loves on him hard, until she is upset at him for chewing a toy and tells us we never
        should have got a dog. Alice drives their little pink Jeep around the farm like she is a boss. Everything is
        more fun with Alice, come and see for yourself! $50 I'll bet that when you start exchanging knock knock jokes
        she will make you laugh.
    </p>

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Ada</h2>

    <p>
        Ada is 7 years old and a second grader in St. Joseph. She taught her little sister how to ride the bus and the
        ins and outs of school. Her, Alice and Everett (cousin neighbor) still manage to fit all three of them in a bus
        seat together :) On the bus they enjoy eating tictacs, looking at small toys they hide in their backpacks, and
        not talking to each other (tired from getting up at 6:20am). Ada's hobbies include hip-hop dance class and
        Gymnastics. She doesn't believe any food is desert unless it is chocolate. When you look at Ada, you can tell a
        lot is going on in her mind, but you can rarely tell how she is feeling- very unlike her sister. She feels
        deeply, and says caring is her super power but also reserves any token of affection for friends and family whom
        she has known pretty much for life. We love her fiercely and can't wait till she marries Alice and builds a
        house behind ours because she loves us all so much.
    </p>

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Kristina</h2>

    <p>
        Kristina loves to continue to stay involved with as many friends as possible, planning get togethers or inviting
        people to days at the farm whenever possible. Joe may think she has no hobbies, however she fires back that
        following music, artists, and going to concerts is as good of a hobby as any. This year was just like any other
        as she attended 8 concerts of the Milk and Honey patio sessions, The Head and the Heart/ Revivalists and Lindsey
        Stirling at the Ledge Amphitheater, Cirque De Solie, Into the Woods at the Guthrie, P!nk/Brandi in Fargo, Brandi
        and Wynonna Judd at the State Fair, and Beauty and the Beast at the Paramount. Kristina's job has been mediocre
        with some ups and down in the past year, although she really loves getting to review nursing home patients'
        medications with abnormal levels of excitement. In 2024 she hopes to go on more date nights with her husband to
        sushi restaurants.

    <h2>üî¶ Spotlight on Joe</h2>

    <p>
        Joe has upgraded his homebrewing system and kegerator and has been brewing up a storm. Averaging one batch per
        month now, which is an increase from only a couple of batches per year since the kids were born. He enjoys the
        fruits of his labor while watching the Vikings, playing poker with friends, posthumously appreciating the humor
        of Norm MacDonald, or sitting on the patio watching for Northern Lights.
    </p>
    <p>
        During deer hunting season, he got one of his best bucks ever, a decent sized 8-pointer. He has added a compound
        bow to his arsenal to extend his hunting season, and he's been practicing with it all summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        He's still very slowly learning the ropes on the farm. We got a batch of 60 meat chickens this spring, and those
        are in the freezer now. We added a new set of egg layers too, and we're expecting those hens to start laying
        eggs any day now (fingers crossed). He tried shearing the sheep himself this year, and now fully appreciates
        being able to hire a professional to do it. The new chicken coop is working out great, and Joe and Jim have made
        some nice improvements to the fencing in the sheep barn and lambing jugs. He's still clueless in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking into 2024, Joe has plans to dabble in timber framing. He has acquired some books, simple project plans,
        and a few of the tools of the trade. A delivery of timbers from a sawyer in Little Falls are expected late
        December or early January. Check back next year to see how that goes!

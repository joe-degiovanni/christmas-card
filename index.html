    <h2>🏠 We moved!</h2>

    <p>
        It was a big adjustment from our 1/3 acre lot in Sartell to 40 acres in St. Joseph.
        We are lucky to have Jim and Mary living next to us to help train us into living on the farm. Our
        house sold in June and it was fun watching construction of the new house from foundation to finish over the
        summer. We're super excited, but have a lot to learn!
    </p>

        Our new address is:
        <address>
            12822 County Road 51<br/>
            Saint Joseph MN 56374

    <h2>✈️ We traveled!</h2>

    <p>
        Kristina and I got to travel to Colorado with Mike and Erin to Golden, Colorado for a live Jason Isbell
        performance at Red Rocks. We had a lot of fun over the 4th of July holiday with our friends in Wisconsin Dells.
    </p>
    <p>
        The highlight of our travels was bringing the whole family to England to visit the Bowerman family. Missing
        Hannah and Lewis's wedding in 2021 was a huge disappointment, but we were so excited to meet their baby boy
        George after finally being able to travel there this year! We owe a Yuuuuuge "Thank you!" to Mary and Paul for
        being amazing hosts despite the chaos we unleashed on their lovely English home village :-) Rachel was an
        amazing tour guide as well! We can't wait to come back and visit again!
